abstract: "**Summary:** A deep learning bone age prediction model generalized well to an external test set but demonstrated clinically significant sex-, age-, and sexual maturity–based biases.\n **Key Results:** (1) A bone age deep learning model (2017 RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge winner) had similar performance for an internal validation set (1425 radiographs) compared with an external test set (1202 radiographs), with mean absolute differences of 6.8 and 6.9 months of age, respectively (P = .64). (2) The deep learning model resulted in bone age errors in 194 of 1202 radiographs (16%) in the external test set that would change clinical diagnosis (normal, delayed, or advanced for chronologic age) compared with the results of two experienced radiologists."
