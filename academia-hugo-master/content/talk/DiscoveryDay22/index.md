abstract: "**Background.** To increase accessibility of deep learning (DL) to individuals without coding expertise, companies have developed code-free DL (CFDL) platforms. However, their usability and performance for chest radiographs (CXR) has not been studied. Purpose. We evaluated the performance and usability of CFDL platforms in creating DL models for disease classification, object detection, and segmentation in CXR. **Materials and Methods.** We evaluated six CFDL platforms. We trained single-label and multilabel classifiers for thoracic pathologies using Guangzhou Pediatric and NIH-CXR14 datasets and performed external validation using subsets of NIH-CXR14 and Stanford CheXpert datasets, respectively. Detection and segmentation models used the RSNA Pneumonia and SIIM Pneumothorax datasets, respectively. Model performance was evaluated using F1-scores (only common platform metric). Usability was evaluated for feasibility of image uploading, model training, ease-of-use, and cost. **Results.** NIH-CXR14 and CheXpert datasets contained 112,120 (mean age, 46.6 years +/- 16.6; 63,340 men) and 151,522 images (mean age, 60.7+/-17.7, 88,931 men), respectively. The other datasets did not report demographics (Guangzhou, 5826 images; RSNA 26,683 images; SIIM 15,301 images). Guangzhou pneumonia classifiers demonstrated good internal (F1 0.929-0.986) and poor external performance (F1 0.386-0.436). Multilabel NIH-CXR14 classifiersâ€™ internal and external performance were both poor (F1 0.00-0.361 and 0.00-0.761, respectively). NIH-CXR14 single-label classifiers performed poorly (F1 0.00, all). The single successful pneumonia detection model had 0.481 F1. No segmentation model was successful. Platform usability was limited, with all requiring some type of coded solution. **Conclusion.** CFDL platforms have limited performance and usability. We recommend caution in using CFDL platforms for CXR analysis and highlight areas for improvement."
